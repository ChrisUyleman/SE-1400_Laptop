        <p class="maintext">We believe that pricing should be fair to 
          everyone in a given transaction. This means
          that we will make sure our prices are as low
          as we can make them, while still being fair
          to ourselves for our work.<br><br>
          
          If you have a problem with our pricing, let us
          know! We will be happy to work with you in 
          finding a price that is more budget-friendly.<br><br>
          
          At Sunbros, we are happy to give pricing 
          before we do any work at all, just so that
          you can know how our work will fit into your
          budget. In other words, quotes are always
          free!</p>

        <p class="maintext">We are proud to say that Sunbros provides quality assurance to our clients.
          Should any work not go as intended, we will be happy to fix it until it has 
          been done right. <br><br>
          
          Our work is generally done the right way the first time, although sometimes a
          sticky situation arrives, and we might need to do things over. Should this ever
          occur, we will not charge our clients anything except the cost of materials.<br><br>
          
          If you have had work done, and are unhappy with the results, rest assured
          knowing that we will do everything in our power to
          make it right by you.</p>
